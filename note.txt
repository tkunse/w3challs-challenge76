A smart way to hide plain text by combining the characters from other sentences.

It should be much easier if you just debug it. But I use IDA and is not able to run debugger like windbg or ollydbg, so I still use IDA. I can figure a way out.

To prevent some awful mistakes, I write an easy program to get the password.
If you just look at the first block of code, you will get this string:
biKqfrd\m
But when you type it into the program, it tells you that the password is wrong.
Actually, another block of code rewrites the values and the new string should be:
biKq_l4gz
And then it tells you that it is the correct password.
